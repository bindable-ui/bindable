                        Elements are designed to accomplish a very specific task. For example if you want a Delete Confirmation tip to show on a delete button you'd use the e-delete-confirm element. The difference between an element and a component is that you can use components for many different reasons and put different types of data in them while an Element is only used for one thing. The c-button component is a good example. You could use the c-button to save, edit, open a modal and the text in the button could be whatever you want. In contrast the e-delete-confrim element is only used to confirm a delete action. You can't make it do anything else and its contents are set.
