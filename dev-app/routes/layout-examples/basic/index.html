					A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I'll alert the crew. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? What? We're not at all alike! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Computer, lights up! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Well, that's certainly good to know. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?

					The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I'll be sure to note that in my log. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Not if I weaken first. Ensign Babyface! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! This should be interesting. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Damage report! Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? The look in your eyes, I recognize it.

					You used to have it for me. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. They were just sucked into space. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Your head is not an artifact! Talk about going nowhere fast. Sorry, Data. I am your worst nightmare! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The unexpected is our normal routine.

					Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? How long can two people talk about nothing? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. and attack the Romulans. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? We have a saboteur aboard.

				Computer, belay that order. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. You enjoyed that. Your shields were failing, sir. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Besides, you look good in a dress. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.
